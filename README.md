# irony-detection
The baseline code and data are from he Github repository for [SemEval-2018 Task 3](https://github.com/chialun-yeh/SemEval2018-Task3).  
This repo is for the final project of the course Information Retrival at TU Delft, and the data is used to develop our algorithms only.

We intend to first reproduce the paper **"Monday mornings are my fave :) #not Exploring the Automatic Recognition of Irony in English tweets"** from Cynthia Van Hee et al.
